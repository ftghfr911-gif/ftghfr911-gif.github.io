I am a Research Scientist at [NVIDIA Spatial Intelligence Lab](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/sil/) led by Prof. [Sanja Fidler](https://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~fidler/). I obtained my PhD from National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. [Mike Shou](https://sites.google.com/view/showlab) and Prof. [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/). My research interests include generative models for images, videos, 3D and 4D.
